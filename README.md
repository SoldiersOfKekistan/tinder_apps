- app.py            Local tinder application                            Tkinter, Pillow
- bio_merger.py     Merges bios for faster text analisation             
- bio_length.py     Plots bio length distribution                       matplotlib
- histogram.py      Interactive histograms                              Tkinter

Start with setting up your path in path.py.
Python 3+ is expected for running any of the files.
Further information and manuals are in the files.

Planned features:
- word frequency analisis targeting swearing and sexual words
- picture statistics targeting number of faces found
- neural network to recognise specific groups of people
- GAN neural network to generate faces from specific groups of people
